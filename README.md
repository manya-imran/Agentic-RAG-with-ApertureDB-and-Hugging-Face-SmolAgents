# Agentic-RAG-with-ApertureDB-and-Hugging-Face-SmolAgents

Agentic RAG revolutionizes the traditional RAG architecture by introducing iterative querying, refining, and quality assessments of the query and responses. This dynamic reasoning process leads to more accurate and context-aware answers.  Integrating ApertureDB enhances this approach by using graph-based data storage to preserve context, making it easier for agents to reason and act effectively.

ApertureDBâ€™s high-performance capabilities make it well-suited for handling complex datasets like Arxiv papers.This flow introduces dynamic reasoning, query refinement and iteration, response improvement, and high retrieval enhances the performance compared to the traditional static pipelines. 

This implementation highlights the Agentic RAG implementation using ApertureDB data store, which is a graph-based multimodal database. Hugging Face SmolAgents will be employed for implementing a multi-agent LLM workflow.
